# Parallel Subagent Execution

When given broad or multi-part tasks, **always run subagents in parallel** when the subtasks are independent:

## Rules:

1. **Identify independent subtasks** - Tasks that don't depend on each other's output
2. **Launch multiple Task tool calls in a single message** - This runs them concurrently
3. **Maximum 4 parallel agents** - Don't exceed this limit at once
4. **Use appropriate subagent types:**
   - `explore` - For codebase exploration, finding files, understanding code
   - `generalPurpose` - For complex multi-step tasks
   - `shell` - For terminal/git operations
   - `browser-use` - For web testing

## Examples:

**User:** "Set up authentication, add payment integration, and create an admin dashboard"

**Agent should:** Launch 3 parallel explore agents to research each area simultaneously, then implement.

**User:** "Check the frontend for bugs and also review the backend API"

**Agent should:** Launch 2 parallel agents - one for frontend, one for backend.

## Trigger Phrases:
- "do X and Y and Z"
- "check multiple things"
- "broad task" / "multiple features"
- "explore the codebase"
- "find all issues"
