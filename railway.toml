# Toora — Railway per-service configuration.
# Both 'web' and 'worker' use the root Dockerfile.
# railway.toml is scoped to the service Railway links it to.
# Since railway.toml is at the repo root and Railway reads it per-service,
# the start command below applies to whichever service is currently deploying.
# The WORKER service must have its Start Command set to:
#   python worker/main.py
# in the Railway dashboard (Service Settings → Deploy → Start Command).
